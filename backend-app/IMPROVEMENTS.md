## 1. Advanced Feature Engineering

- **Price Features:** Historical prices, discounts, promotions, price elasticity.//TO DO
- **Stock/Inventory Features:** Stock-outs, inventory levels over time.
- **Product Lifecycle:** Time since launch, lifecycle phase.
- **External Data:** Weather, economic indicators, competitor pricing.
- **Marketing/Campaigns:** Email, ads, promotions.
- **Calendar Events:** Holidays, Black Friday, local events.

## 2. Modeling Enhancements

- **Hierarchical Forecasting:** Product and category-level reconciliation.
- **Ensemble Improvements:** Stacking/blending SARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM.
- **Model Selection:** Choose best model per product type.
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Confidence intervals, quantile regression.

## 3. Business Optimization Layer

- **Inventory Optimization:** Integrate forecasts with cost models (holding, stock-out, ordering).
- **Automated Replenishment:** Generate purchase/reorder suggestions based on forecast and lead times.

## 4. Productionization & MLOps

- **Automated Retraining:** Schedule regular model retraining.
- **Model Monitoring:** Track accuracy, drift, and alert on anomalies.
