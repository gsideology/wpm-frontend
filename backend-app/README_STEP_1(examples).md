# WooCommerce Predictive Demand Model

## Overview

This project implements an ensemble-based predictive demand forecasting system for WooCommerce stores. It leverages time series and machine learning models to optimize inventory, reduce stock-outs, and improve business outcomes.

## Architecture

- **Data Sources:** WooCommerce, external APIs (weather, economic, etc.)
- **Feature Store:** Sales history, seasonality, promotions, external variables
- **Models:** SARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM (ensemble)
- **Prediction:** 12-month forecasts, confidence intervals, product/category level
- **Monitoring:** Drift detection, performance tracking, alerts

## Tech Stack

- Python (scikit-learn, statsmodels, prophet, xgboost, tensorflow)
- pandas, numpy, dask
- Airflow, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Streamlit (dashboard)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env`
4. Run data ingestion and model scripts
5. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard.py`

## Project Structure

- `data_ingestion/` — Scripts to pull and clean data
- `feature_engineering/` — Feature creation pipelines
- `models/` — Model training and ensemble logic
- `evaluation/` — Metrics and reporting
- `deployment/` — Scripts for retraining, monitoring, and serving

## Phases

1. MVP: Prophet baseline, manual pipeline, simple dashboard
2. Enhanced: Add SARIMA/XGBoost, automate features, category-level
3. Production: Full ensemble, MLOps, monitoring

## Metrics

- MAPE, RMSE, MAE
- Inventory turnover, stock-out/overstock reduction
